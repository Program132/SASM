# Errors Codes

While you are coding in SASM, you can do some errors like forget to specify a value, an operator etc.
If you get one, you have a number after the example and the description of the error.
This file will summarize what are these numbers if you did not read the description of the error.

- 1: *You have to give a register.*
- 2: *Need the operator `,`.*
- 3: *Need the operator `#`.*
- 4: *Need a value for the register.*
- 5: *You can have more than 13 Registers (from R0 to R12).*
- 6: *The slot given is not available. This slot has no value.*
- 7: *The register does not exist.*
- 8: *You have to give the name of a label.*
- 9: *Need a conditional action (equal, bigger or equal, bigger, lower or equal, lower).*
